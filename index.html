<li>-Bio: Scoobert Doo (Scooby doo)is a Great Dane who only slightly loves to solve mysteries. 
The only thing he truly loves other than Shaggy, is food. He will do close to anything for a Scooby snack. 
Scooby has a speech impediment and tends to pronounce most words as if they begin with an "R"; however, 
most characters are able to understand him almost perfectly. In most iterations, he keeps his sentences 
relatively short, usually using charades for anything longer than three or four words. His catchphrase 
usually howled at the end of every production, is "Scooby-Dooby-Doo!" or "Rooby-Rooby-Roo"!</li>
